once the isEditing flag is set to true for a specific item in the sItems list inside the onEditClick callback in the else block, 
the LazyColumn will recompose, and the if (item.isEditing) block will be true for that particular item. This will lead to the display of the ShoppingItemEditor 
instead of the regular ShoppingListItem for that specific item in the list.

The flow is as follows:

1.Initially, isEditing is false for all items, and the ShoppingListItem is displayed for each item in the LazyColumn.
2.When the user clicks the "Edit" button for a specific item, the onEditClick callback is triggered, setting isEditing to true for that item.
3.The LazyColumn recomposes, and for that specific item, the condition if (item.isEditing) becomes true, leading to the display of ShoppingItemEditor instead 
of ShoppingListItem.
4.The ShoppingItemEditor allows the user to edit the item.
5.After editing and clicking the "Save" button in ShoppingItemEditor, the onEditComplete callback is triggered, and isEditing is set to false for all items in the sItems list.

So, the flow doesn't directly go back to the if statement in the LazyColumn. Instead, the recomposition of the LazyColumn is triggered by changes in the sItems list, 
and the appropriate UI (either ShoppingListItem or ShoppingItemEditor) is displayed based on the isEditing flag for each item in the list.
